# Lab7

For this lab we had two codes.  One was the CSS file that would pull the data from the MSP430 and sensors, and the other Visual Studio file was for sending the information to a ThinkSpeak Channel.

CCS: For the CSS we implemented a UART system to transmit the samplers serially in 8-bit ascii format.

Visual Studios:   This visual studio code receives the transmitted data in the 8-bit ascii format and converts it to an integer.
